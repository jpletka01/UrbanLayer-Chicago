# Project Handoff — Chicago City Intelligence

A snapshot of what's been built, the decisions behind it, and what should come next. Companion to `README.md` (user-facing setup) and `~/.claude/plans/velvet-gliding-salamander.md` (the original implementation plan).

---

## TL;DR

A RAG-powered chat interface for natural-language questions about Chicago. Combines live Chicago Data Portal (Socrata) data with semantic search over the entire Chicago Municipal Code. Single killer query: *"What's going on near 2400 N Milwaukee Ave?"* → a unified response covering crime, 311, building activity, business licenses, and applicable zoning, all from one prompt.

**Current status (2026-05-28):** Full pipeline operational. Ingestion complete (14,628 chunks in Qdrant). Eval suite passes 26/26 queries (100%). Multi-turn conversation synthesis added. Chat UI significantly improved with per-message citation binding, typewriter effects, and source preview tooltips. Most recent work: the context/data sidebar was redesigned — citations now render as the actual `§` section reference, cross-references are clickable and open a full-section viewer, and a Tailwind-token bug that made panels render with transparent backgrounds was fixed.

## Stack (Locked)

| Layer | Choice | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3.11 + FastAPI | Async-first, OpenAPI for free, easy SSE |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude **Sonnet 4.6** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) for both router and synthesizer | Latest non-Opus model, better tool-use, structured output reliability |
| Vector DB | **Qdrant v1.9.0** (Docker, self-hosted) | Free, fast, good metadata filtering, payload search supports cross-ref lookup |
| Embeddings | **`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`** via sentence-transformers (local, 384-dim, 512-token context) | Originally chose MiniLM-L6 (256-token context, too small for legal sections); upgraded during Title-17 work. Same dim → Qdrant config unchanged |
| Streaming | **SSE** (`text/event-stream`) | Synthesizer is the slow part (~3–8s); streaming TTFT is much better UX |
| Chat memory | **Multi-turn from day one**, history in client `localStorage`, server is stateless | Simplest persistence model, scales |
| Geocoding | **Census Geocoder** (free, no key) + shapely point-in-polygon against cached community-area polygons | No rate limit, no API key, deterministic |
| Frontend | **React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind v3** | Type-safe contract with FastAPI Pydantic via OpenAPI |
| Doc ingest | **Parse local `chicago-il-codes.html`** (American Legal Publishing export, ~100MB) | Originally tried scraping Municode (deleted); the local HTML export is much more reliable |

Decisions that came up later and were resolved:
- The HTML file has a malformed div somewhere in Title 18 that causes lxml/html.parser to silently nest the trailing ~8MB (the republished Titles 16/17 "Zoning + Land Use Ordinance" volume) inside an earlier element. Worked around by splitting the file at the republication banner string and parsing each half separately. Without this, 250 republished sections and 1 net-new section were missing.
- Sentence-transformers import is lazy inside `vector_search._model()` so FastAPI can boot without the heavy torch dependency installed.
- Qdrant pinned to v1.9.0 because Docker Hub had issues with `:latest` tag and to ensure reproducible builds.
- Vector search uses raw HTTP API (httpx) instead of qdrant-client Python library due to client v1.18.x incompatibility with server v1.9.0.

## What's Done

Everything below is in the repo, tested and verified.

### Backend (`backend/`)
- `main.py` — FastAPI app, `/chat` SSE endpoint with phase timing events, `/autocomplete`, and `/section/{section_id}` (full reassembled municipal-code section, backs clickable cross-references)
- `router.py` — Claude-based router producing strict `RetrievalPlan` JSON; system prompt embeds the 77 community-area names + 30+ neighborhood aliases + **search query guidance for zoning-specific terminology**
- `synthesizer.py` — streaming Claude synthesis call with **inline citation markers** (`[1]`, `[2]`) for code chunks
- `conversation.py` — **Multi-turn context synthesis** with improved heuristics for detecting follow-up questions, context references ("their", "it", "what about"), and clarification answers
- `assembler.py` — pure context-merging function with caps (top-5 crime types, top-15 311 types, top-5 chunks), `Open - Dup` dedup, auto data-lag note
- `models.py` — Pydantic types: `RetrievalPlan`, `ContextObject`, `ChatChunk` (with `t_ms` timing), `Message`, `ChatRequest`
- `config.py` — env via pydantic-settings (Anthropic key, Socrata token, Qdrant URL, model/dataset IDs)
- `retrieval/`:
  - `socrata.py` — shared async client with retry/backoff, `X-App-Token`, `$limit` guard
  - `crime.py` — `ijzp-q8t2` (neighborhood-aggregated + block-level), uses two parallel queries for crime counts + arrest counts (SoQL `case()` doesn't exist)
  - `three11.py` — `v6vf-nfxy` (open requests + response times, `Open - Dup` filtered)
  - `buildings.py` — `ydr8-5enu` permits (uses `reported_cost` field) + `22u3-xenr` violations
  - `business.py` — `uupf-x98q` active licenses
  - `vector_search.py` — Qdrant semantic search via raw HTTP API + payload-filter cross-ref expansion, lazy embedder; `get_full_section()` reassembles a whole section from its chunks for the `/section` endpoint
  - `geo.py` — 77 community areas + alias table + Census Geocoder + shapely
- `tests/` — **130+ tests** (unit + integration), all passing

### Ingestion (`ingestion/`)
- `parse_chicago_code.py` — HTML parser with split-at-republication strategy, state machine for Title→Chapter→Article→Subarticle→Part, colspan/rowspan-aware table extraction with composite multi-row headers
- `chunk.py` — section-aware chunking with hierarchical header re-duplication, table flattening to `Row N: header=value`, sub-section splits inside tables at category boundaries (`A. Household Living`, `PUBLIC AND CIVIC`)
- `embed_and_store.py` — sentence-transformers + Qdrant upsert to two collections (`chicago_municipal_code`, `chicago_zoning` for Title 17 filter-free)
- `load_community_areas.py` — fetches and caches community-area polygons from Socrata `igwz-8jzy` as GeoJSON
- **Pipeline fully run**: 8,615 sections → 14,628 chunks → Qdrant (took ~3 minutes with MPS acceleration)

### Frontend (`frontend/`)
- Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind v3 scaffold
- State machine in `App.tsx`: splash (hero slideshow + chat pill + suggestion chips + ingestion stats grid) → split-screen workspace
- **Per-message context architecture** — Each assistant message stores its own `context` snapshot so citations remain valid across multi-turn conversations
- **Inline citation pills** — `[1]`, `[2]` markers rendered as clickable `CitationPill` components with hover tooltips showing source preview
- **Typewriter effect** — `useTypewriter` hook for character-by-character text reveal during streaming
- **Copy functionality** — Hover-revealed copy buttons on messages and source cards
- **Source panel** — Collapsible sidebar with "Sources" button (top-right), showing code chunks with relevance scores, cross-references, and expandable detail drawer
- Components:
  - `HeroSlideshow` (5 Unsplash photos, cross-fade)
  - `ChatInput` (glassmorphism pill, hero + compact variants, address autocomplete)
  - `MessageBubble` (react-markdown, inline citations, copy button, typewriter)
  - `CitationPill` (renders a `[N]` marker as the `§ <section>` reference + ordinal; hover tooltip; click opens/expands/flashes the source)
  - `DataPill` (colored `[data:*]` marker → opens Data tab, scrolls to card)
  - `SourceCitation` (card with rank badge, `§` pill, score, prose preview, in-place full-text expansion, clickable cross-refs)
  - `CrossRefPill` (clickable cross-reference with hover-preview of the target section)
  - `SourceDetailDrawer` (full-section viewer for a clicked cross-reference; opaque elevated panel, chained cross-ref navigation)
  - `sidebar/DataView`, `sidebar/SourcesView` (the two sidebar tabs)
  - `SidebarPanel`, `SidebarToggle` (collapsible context/data panel)
  - `DisclaimerBanner` (amber, legal disclaimer)
  - `HistorySidebar` (conversation history)
- `lib/`:
  - `api.ts` (SSE fetch streaming; `fetchSection` with an immutable-section cache)
  - `history.ts` (localStorage conversations)
  - `types.ts` (matches backend Pydantic, extended with per-message context)
  - `useTypewriter.ts` (character reveal hook)
  - `clipboard.ts` (copy utility)
  - `codeRefs.ts` (`isResolvableSection`, `stripHeader` helpers)
- **Builds cleanly** (~322KB JS, 16KB CSS)

### Benchmarks & Eval (`eval/`)
- **Parser stats** — `python -m ingestion.parse_chicago_code --stats` prints per-title section/table/xref/definition/legislative-history counts
- **Per-phase latency** — every SSE event carries `t_ms`. Sidebar renders Router / Retrieval / Synthesis-TTFT / Total live
- **Query test set** — `eval/queries.json` has **26 representative queries**
- **Baseline established**: 26/26 passing (100%), latency p50: router 2.4s, retrieval 3.8s, total 13.6s

## What's NOT Done / Known Issues

### 1. ~~Citation tooltip overlaps text (transparent background)~~ — RESOLVED (2026-05-28)
Root cause was broader than the tooltip: `tailwind.config.js` had a dead top-level `'bg-dark'` color colliding with the nested `dark.bg`, so the dev JIT silently dropped `.bg-dark-bg` and every panel using it (sidebar, workspace, section drawer) rendered transparent. Removed the dead token; gave the section drawer an explicit `bg-[#141414] shadow-2xl` + darker backdrop. See session log below.

### 2. ~~Source detail drawer covers sidebar~~ — RESOLVED (2026-05-28)
Source cards now expand **in-place** in `SourceCitation.tsx` (full text shown inline, no height cap). The `SourceDetailDrawer` was repurposed for a different job: viewing the full text of a *cross-referenced* section fetched on demand (see session log).

### 3. Typewriter effect stops after first citation
The typewriter animation works initially but dumps remaining text all at once after the first `[1]` citation appears. **Root cause:** The `renderChildrenWithCitations` function in `MessageBubble.tsx` may be causing re-renders that reset the typewriter state. Needs investigation.

### 4. ~~No annotations for API-sourced data~~ — RESOLVED
Socrata statistics are now marked with `[data:crime]` / `[data:311]` / etc. markers rendered as colored `DataPill` components that open the Data tab and scroll to the relevant card.

### 5. The Municipal Code is gitignored
- `chicago-il-codes.html` (~100MB) is not in version control (`.gitignore` line 17).
- Anyone cloning the repo needs to obtain it separately.

### 6. Stretch goals (Phase I)
- **Leaflet map view** showing crime pins, 311 markers, zoning overlay. *Not started.*

### 7. Deferred but probably worth doing
- **LLM-as-judge eval** — grade synthesis answers for citation accuracy + factuality
- **Cost/token logging** — wrap the Anthropic client to record tokens per request
- **Deployment** — currently local-only
- **Postgres / server-side history** — for multi-device sync

### 8. Known fragile heuristics
- **Sub-header detection inside tables** uses length cap (<80 chars)
- **Multi-row header count** inferred from consecutive row patterns
- **Cross-references** filter to section IDs only

## Session Log (2026-05-28 — Afternoon Session)

Work completed in this session (Chat UI QoL improvements):

1. **Per-message context architecture** — Extended `Message` type with optional `context` field. Each assistant message now stores its own context snapshot when streaming completes. Citations in old messages remain valid even after follow-up questions.

2. **Sidebar toggle visibility fix** — Moved toggle button outside the collapsible sidebar. Now shows as a "Sources" button in top-right corner with document icon and source count badge.

3. **Character-by-character typewriter effect** — Created `useTypewriter` hook with proper state management (useState instead of refs), cleanup on every effect run, and ~15ms per character reveal.

4. **Inline citation pills** — Created `CitationPill` component with:
   - Document icon + number badge
   - Hover tooltip showing section title and text preview
   - Click to open sidebar and highlight source

5. **Enhanced source cards** — Updated `SourceCitation` with:
   - Index badge matching citation number
   - Highlight state when selected
   - Cross-reference display
   - Copy button on hover
   - "Read more" indicator

6. **Source detail drawer** — Created `SourceDetailDrawer` for full source text view with copy functionality.

7. **Copy functionality** — Added clipboard utility and hover-revealed copy buttons to messages and sources.

8. **Conversation synthesis improvements** — Rewrote `needs_synthesis()` in `backend/conversation.py` to detect:
   - Very short answers (<50 chars) after assistant questions
   - Context references ("their", "it", "what about", etc.)
   - Follow-up question patterns ("do you have", "how do I", etc.)
   - Short questions lacking explicit location

9. **Backend citation prompt** — Updated `synthesizer.py` system prompt to instruct LLM to emit `[1]`, `[2]` citation markers.

## Session Log (2026-05-28 — Context & Data Sidebar Redesign)

Driven by user feedback on the side panel. All changes verified by driving the running app with headless Chromium (Playwright), not just unit tests.

1. **De-cluttered the Data tab** — removed the dev-facing "Latency" benchmarks card and "Active Sources" chips from `sidebar/DataView.tsx`. The live data cards (crime / 311 / permits / violations / business) stay — they're the evidence behind each answer — along with the data-lag note. Dropped the `PhaseTimings` plumbing from `App.tsx` / `SidebarPanel.tsx` that fed the removed card.

2. **Sources tab is now the default** whenever an answer used code sections (`App.tsx` sets the view from `context.code_chunks` on each `context` event); Data is only the default when there are no sources.

3. **Readability pass on sources** (`SourceCitation.tsx`) — section IDs render as `§ <id>` mono pills, the 1–5 rank is a filled circular badge, the collapsed preview is plain prose (header stripped via `lib/codeRefs.ts`) instead of a dense monospace block, and the expanded full text no longer has a `max-h` cap so the whole chunk is readable.

4. **Citations are the section reference itself** — the synthesizer prompt (`synthesizer.py` rule 1) now tells the model to drop a `[N]` marker where the reference belongs and NOT spell out the section number; the frontend renders each `[N]` as a `§ <section>` mono pill with a small ordinal (`CitationPill.tsx`). Clicking a citation opens the sidebar → Sources, scrolls to + auto-expands the source to full size, and plays a one-shot `animate-flash` pulse (re-fires on repeat clicks via a `sourceFlash` counter in `App.tsx`).

5. **Clickable cross-references → full-section viewer** — new `GET /section/{section_id}` endpoint (`main.py`) backed by `vector_search.get_full_section()`, which reassembles a complete section from all its chunks (orders by `chunk_index`, strips repeated headers + `(part N of M)` labels, unions cross-refs). The previously-dead `SourceDetailDrawer.tsx` was repurposed into the viewer for this, with chained cross-ref navigation. Cross-ref pills (`CrossRefPill.tsx`) are clickable and **hover-preview** the target section (title + 3-line snippet), reusing the citation-tooltip pattern; `fetchSection` (`lib/api.ts`) is memoized so the hover prefetch and click share one request. Note: some cross-refs point to sections not in the corpus and 404 — the drawer/tooltip handle that with a graceful "not available" state.

6. **Fixed transparent panel backgrounds (the drawer-overlap bug)** — `tailwind.config.js` had a dead top-level `'bg-dark': '#090d16'` color (never referenced) colliding with the nested `dark.bg`; the collision made the dev Tailwind JIT silently NOT emit `.bg-dark-bg`, so the sidebar, workspace, and section drawer all rendered with transparent backgrounds (invisible normally because `<body>` is dark, but it caused the section drawer's text to overlap the sidebar). Deleted the dead token and gave the drawer an explicit `bg-[#141414] shadow-2xl` + `bg-black/70` backdrop. **If panels ever look see-through again, check for this kind of Tailwind color-name collision first.**

New files: `frontend/src/components/CrossRefPill.tsx`, `frontend/src/lib/codeRefs.ts` (`isResolvableSection`, `stripHeader`).

---

## Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Step 1 — Debug typewriter + citations interaction
Investigate why typewriter effect stops working after first citation. May need to memoize citation processing or adjust how content is passed to the hook. (Issue #3 — still open.)

### Step 2 — Decide how to handle un-resolvable cross-references
Some cross-refs point to sections not in the corpus and return 404 (handled gracefully today as "not available"). Options: hide them rather than render clickable, or investigate why those sections are missing from ingestion.

### Step 3 — Test multi-turn conversations thoroughly
The conversation synthesis should now handle follow-ups like "do you have their website?" — verify this works in practice.

### Step 4 — Stretch: Leaflet map view
Crime pins, 311 markers, zoning overlay. Not started.

## How to Get Productive Quickly

If you're a fresh agent picking this up:

1. **Read in this order**: `README.md` (user setup) → `HANDOFF.md` (this file)
2. **Check current state**: 
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m pytest backend/tests/ -q  # Should pass
   cd frontend && npm run build         # Should succeed
   ```
3. **Verify env**: `.env` should have `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN` set
4. **Files most likely to need edits**:
   - `frontend/src/components/MessageBubble.tsx` — typewriter/citation interaction (Issue #3)
   - `frontend/src/lib/useTypewriter.ts` — animation timing
   - `frontend/src/components/CrossRefPill.tsx` / `SourceDetailDrawer.tsx` — cross-reference behavior
   - `backend/retrieval/vector_search.py` — `get_full_section` / cross-ref resolution

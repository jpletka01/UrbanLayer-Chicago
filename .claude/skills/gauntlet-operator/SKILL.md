# Operating a Gauntlet run in this repository

This repo runs on Gauntlet, so a live run moves through a state machine that
pauses for human decisions and can wedge in ways that need a careful, guarded
response. Before you touch anything, open the playbook at `.gauntlet/prompts/operator.md` and
follow it — that file holds this project's triage tree, the meaning of each
run-state, and which command resolves which one. Treat it as the source; this
skill only sends you there.

The reflex it teaches, worth internalizing up front:

- **Ask the tool, do not infer.** Begin with `gauntlet status <slug>`; it
  computes the real state — including whether the driver is actually alive — and
  prints the next command. `gauntlet status <slug> --json` is the same answer for
  a script.
- **Read before you mutate.** `gauntlet logs <slug>` surfaces a failing step's
  evidence; reach for it before resuming anything.
- **Recover is narrow and guarded.** `gauntlet recover <slug>` is only for a
  proven-alive, wedged driver, and it never auto-resumes.
- **Run every verb from the operator's checkout.** A run edits its OWN worktree
  at `.gauntlet/worktrees/<slug>/<run-id>` inside your repo — that is the
  default, not an opt-in — so the agent's edits do not appear in your tree.
  `status --json` prints the exact path under `worktree`. Read the run branch
  with `git log`/`git diff`/`git show` from where you are; never `git checkout`
  it (git refuses while the run holds it) and never run a gauntlet verb from
  inside the run worktree (the CLI refuses, and tells you where to stand).
- **Nothing moves a run's tree for you.** A run started before the dedicated
  layout became the default — or one deliberately pinned to
  `worktree.mode: same_tree` — keeps driving your checkout;
  `gauntlet migrate-worktree <slug>` is the only thing that moves it, it is
  optional, and `status` offers it when the run is eligible. `--rollback`
  undoes it. A run that cannot migrate is never wedged by that — it stays fully
  drivable in `same_tree`.

Stay inside your lane: this skill is for operating a run, not building or
reviewing one. A human ratifies every gate, the safety judge is never bypassed,
and the operator never hand-edits files the pipeline owns.
